
## StructuredDataProfiling

The StructuredDataProfiling is a Python library developed to automatically profile structured datasets and to facilitate the creation of **data tests**.

The library creates data tests in the form of **Expectations** using the [great_expectations](https://www.greatexpectations.io) framework. Expectations are 'declarative statements that a computer can evaluate and semantically meaningful to humans'.

An expectation could be, for example, 'the sum of columns a and b should be equal to one' or 'the values in column c should be non-negative'.

StructuredDataProfiling runs a series of tests aimed at identifying statistics, rules, and constraints characterising a given dataset. The information generated by the profiler is collected by performing the following operations:

- Characterise uni- and bi-variate distributions.
- Identify data quality issues.
- Evaluate relationships between attributes (ex. column C is the difference between columns A and B)
- Understand ontologies characterizing categorical data (column A contains names, while B contains geographical places).

For an overview of the library outputs please check the [examples](./examples) section.

# Installation
You can install StructuredDataProfiling by using pip:
`pip install structured-profiling
`
# Quickstart
You can import the profiler using

```python
from structured_data_profiling.profiler import DatasetProfiler
```
You can import the profiler using
```python
profiler = DatasetProfiler('./csv_path.csv')
```
The presence of a primary key (for example to define relations between tables or sequences) can be specified by using the argument **primary key** containing a single or multiple column names.

To start the profiling scripts, you can run the profile() method
```python
profiler.profile()
```
The method generate_expectations() outputs the results of the profiling process converted into data expectations. Please note, the method requires the existence of a local great_expectations project.
If you haven't done so please run ```great_expectations init``` in your working directory.
```python
profiler.generate_expectations()
```
The expectations are generated in a JSON format using the great_expectation schema. The method will also create data docs using the rendered provided by the great_expectations library.

These docs can be found in the local folder ```great_expectations/uncommitted/data_docs```.

# Profiling outputs
The profiler generates 3 json files describing the ingested dataset. These json files contain information about:
- column_profiles: it contains the statistical characterisation of the dataset columns.
- dataset_profile: it highlights issues and limitations affecting the dataset.
- tests: it contains the data tests found by the profiler.

The process of generating expectations makes use of the great_expectations library to produce an HTML file contaning data docs. An example of data doc for a given column can be seen in the image below.

# Examples
You can find a couple of notebook examples in the [examples](./examples) folder.
# To-dos
Disclaimer: this library is still at a very early stage. Among other things, we still need to:

- [ ] Support more data formats (Feather, Parquet)
- [ ] Add more Expectations
- [ ] Integrate PII identification using Presidio
- [ ] Optimise and compile part of the profiling routines using Cython
- [ ] Write library tests
