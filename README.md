
## StructuredDataProfiling

The StructuredDataProfiling is a Python library developed to assess structured datasets and to facilitate the creation of **data tests** through automated data profiling.

The library creates data tests in the form of **Expectations** using the [great_expectation](www.greatexpectations.io) framework. Expectations are 'declarative statements that a computer can evaluate and semantically meaningful to humans'. 

An expectation could be, for example, 'the sum of columns a and b should be equal to one' or 'the values in column c should be non-negative'.

StructuredDataProfiling runs a series of tests aimed at identifying statistics, rules, and constraints characterising a given dataset. The information generated by the profiler is collected by performing the following operations:

- Characterise uni- and bi-variate distributions.
- Identify data quality issues.
- Evaluate relationships between attributes (ex. column C is the difference between columns A and B) 
- Understand ontologies characterizing categorical data (column A contains names, while B contains geographical places).

For an overview of the library outputs please check the examples section.
